      "explanation": "A one-time pad provides perfect secrecy (information-theoretically secure) when the key is truly random, at least as long as the message, used only once, and kept completely secret. It is the only encryption proven to be unbreakable."

      "options": [
        "Improved hardware utilization",
        "Enhanced network security",
        "Simplified application deployment",
        "Reduced data transfer costs"

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Containerization packages applications with their dependencies into portable containers, simplifying deployment across different environments. Containers ensure consistent behavior regardless of where they are deployed."

      "question": "Which encryption algorithm is commonly used to protect data in transit between cloud services and users' devices?",
      "options": [
        "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)",
        "RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)",
        "DES (Data Encryption Standard)",
        "MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "AES is the symmetric encryption algorithm used within TLS to encrypt data in transit. It is the standard for secure communication between cloud services and client devices."

      "question": "What is the main problem with assigning static privileges to administrative users on a database?",
      "options": [
        "Security is dependent upon the login process",
        "Administrative users may forget their privileges",
        "Static privileges are more expensive to implement",
        "Static privileges may not provide enough access"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Static privileges mean that once an admin logs in, they have all assigned privileges regardless of the task. This makes security entirely dependent on the login process, and if credentials are compromised, the attacker gains full access. Dynamic or just-in-time privileges are more secure."
